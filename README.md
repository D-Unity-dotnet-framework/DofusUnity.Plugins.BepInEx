The projet is currently a WIP and doesn't have a stable release yet.
In order to build this project you will need to have the game installed on your computer and have BepInEx installed as well as already launched the game at least once with BepInEx installed in order to generate the necessary files.
Only then you will be able to open the project in Visual Studio and build it.
